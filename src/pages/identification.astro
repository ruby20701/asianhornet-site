    <h1>How to identify the Asian hornet (<em>Vespa velutina</em>)</h1>
    <p>
      The Asian hornet, also called the yellow-legged hornet, is an invasive species established in France
      and now spreading into the UK. Quick, accurate identification is vital to protect pollinators and
      prevent false reports that waste resources.
    </p>

    <h2>Key features</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Smaller than the European hornet (<em>Vespa crabro</em>), usually 19–24 mm (queens up to 30 mm).</li>
      <li>Dark brown or black body with a broad orange band towards the end of the abdomen.</li>
      <li>Yellow legs (“yellow socks”), giving the alternative name yellow-legged hornet.</li>
      <li>Head black with an orange-yellow face.</li>
      <li>Wings appear brown-tinted rather than clear.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Nests</h2>
    <p>
      Asian hornets build large papery nests, often up to 80 cm in size. Nests are usually high in trees,
      but can also be found in buildings, roof spaces, and hedges. They have a smooth surface and a side
      entrance hole. Primary nests in spring may start smaller and lower down, but mature nests are usually
      elevated. Never attempt to approach or remove a nest yourself.
    </p>

    <h2>Comparison with similar species</h2>
    <p>
      This chart shows how the Asian hornet compares in size and colour to the European hornet, common wasp and honey bee.

    <h2>Reporting a sighting</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>In France</strong>: report sightings via your regional authority or government portal.</li>
      <li>
        <strong>In the UK</strong>: use the 
        <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/asian-hornet-uk-sightings" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
          Asian Hornet Watch app
        </a> or DEFRA’s online form.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>If stung</h2>
    <p>
      Hornets and wasps usually do not leave a sting behind. Move away, wash the area with soap and water,
      and apply a cold pack. Seek urgent medical help if stung in the mouth or throat, if you receive
      multiple stings, or if any allergic reaction occurs.
