      <h2>Asian hornet in Europe</h2>
    <p>The Asian hornet (<em>Vespa velutina</em>), also called the yellow-legged hornet, was first found in France in 2004 and has spread rapidly across the country at 60–80 km per year. It is now moving into the UK, with sightings and nests rising every year. This invasive predator attacks honey bees and other pollinators, threatening biodiversity, food crops and beekeeping. Early identification and accurate reporting are vital to slowing its spread.</p>
